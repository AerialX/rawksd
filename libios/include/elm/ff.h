#define _WORD_ACCESS	0
/* The _WORD_ACCESS option defines which access method is used to the word
/  data in the FAT structure.
/
/   0: Byte-by-byte access. Always compatible with all platforms.
/   1: Word access. Do not choose this unless following condition is met.
/
/  When the byte order on the memory is big-endian or address miss-aligned
/  word access results incorrect behavior, the _WORD_ACCESS must be set to 0.
/  If it is not the case, the value can also be set to 1 to improve the
/  performance and code efficiency. */


#define _FS_READONLY	0
/* Setting _FS_READONLY to 1 defines read only configuration. This removes
/  writing functions, f_write, f_sync, f_unlink, f_mkdir, f_chmod, f_rename,
/  f_truncate and useless f_getfree. */

/* The _FS_MINIMIZE option defines minimization level to remove some functions.
