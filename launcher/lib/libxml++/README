libxml++
-------------

This library provides a C++ interface to XML files.  It uses
libxml 2 to access the XML files, and in order to
configure libxml++ you must have both libxml and pkg-config installed.

To get the latest version of libxml++, see http://libxmlplusplus.sourceforge.net/
To contact the developers, send e-mail to the mailing list. We welcome patches, but
it helps to discuss them first.

Read the file 'INSTALL' for instructions to compile and install the library.

See the examples directory for example code.

Use pkg-config to discover the necessary include and linker arguments. For instance,
  pkg-config libxml++-2.6 --cflags --libs
Ideally you would use PKG_CHECK_MODULES in your configure.ac file.
See http://www.murrayc.com for generic help with that.
